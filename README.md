# -Semantic-Text-Similarity-SBERT
This project explores semantic text similarity, clustering, and query-based retrieval using Sentence-BERT (SBERT). It processes the SNLI dataset, extracts sentence embeddings, and applies ML techniques for analysis. Features include cosine similarity, K-Means clustering, PCA visualization, and diverse query-based retrieval.
